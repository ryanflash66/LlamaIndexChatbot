# LlamaIndex Chatbot Documentation

## Overview üåê

The `Unstructured_File_Loader.ipynb` notebook is a powerful tool that is used to load files, construct an index from them, and make that index queryable. It uses a variety of libraries, including `unstructured`, `llama_index`, `langchain`, `openai`, and others, to perform complex tasks like reading files, extracting data, creating an index, and querying the index.

## The Code üöÄ

The code in the file is divided into several sections, and each section accomplishes a specific task.

### Installing Dependencies and Creating Directories

The first block of code is for installing the necessary dependencies and creating a directory for the files. The dependencies include llama-hub, unstructured, langchain, and others. This block can be seen as the setup block for the rest of the notebook.

```python
# !pip install llama-hub unstructured
# !pip install "unstructured[doc,docx,ppt,pptx,pdf,image]"
# !pip install llama-index
# !pip install llama-index --upgrade
# !pip install unstructured --upgrade
# !pip install langchain
# !mkdir data
```

### Getting OpenAI API Key

The next section of the notebook deals with getting the OpenAI API Key. This is required to use the OpenAI's GPT-4 model. The key is stored in the environment variable "OPENAI_API_KEY".

```python
import os
import openai

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = input("Enter OpenAI API Key: ")
openai.api_key = os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]
```

### Loading the Data and Constructing the Index

The most complex part of the notebook is the section for loading the data and constructing the index. This part of the notebook reads files from a directory, extracts the data from them, creates an index, and persists it. The index is created with the help of the LLM (Language Model) Predictor.

```python
def construct_index(directory_path):
    # ... code omitted for brevity ...
    documents = dir_reader.load_data()
    service_context = ServiceContext.from_defaults(llm_predictor=llm_predictor, prompt_helper=prompt_helper)
    index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents, service_context=service_context)
    index.storage_context.persist()
    return index
```

### Querying the Index

Finally, the last part of the notebook is for querying the index. The user can input a query, and the function will return the response from the index.

```python
def ask_jarvis():
    storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(persist_dir="./storage")
    index = load_index_from_storage(storage_context)
    while True:
        query_engine = index.as_query_engine()
        query = input("Hello! What would you like to know?")
        response = query_engine.query(query)
        display(Markdown(f"Response: <b>{response.response}</b>"))
```

This function runs in an infinite loop, allowing the user to ask multiple queries.

## Summary üìù

In summary, `Unstructured_File_Loader.ipynb` is a powerful and complex tool that can handle unstructured files and make the data within them queryable. It uses a variety of advanced libraries and techniques to accomplish this.
