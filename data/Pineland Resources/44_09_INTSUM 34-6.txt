REPUBLIC OF PINELAND (ROP) DAILY INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY (INTSUM)

PERIOD COVERED 0800R, W+82 THROUGH 0759R, W+083

A. GENERAL ASSESSMENT. COUNTER-GUERILLA OPERATIONS REMAIN A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE DAILY ACTIVITIES OF THE NASCENT PRP SECURITY FORCES THAT ARE ALSO DEALING WITH INSTANCES OF REVENGE KILLINGS AND OTHER VIOLENT CRIMES IN THE LARGER URBAN AREAS.  AT THE SAME TIME, BOTH NICHOLAS AND KEEL CHRISTIAN WARNED PRESIDENT PATON THAT HIS POLICIES TOWARD THE POPULATION ARE TOO LENIENT AND THAT THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY (CP), AND OTHER LAWLESS ORGANIZATIONS ARE STILL ACTIVE.  THE PROCRASTINATION ON THE BEHALF OF THE PRP POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT CONTINUES TO CAUSE ESTRANGEMENT BETWEEN THE LIBERAL PROGRESSIVE PARTY (LPP) REGIME AND LAW ENFORCEMENT ORGANIZATIONS (ISC) IN THE PRP.

      A. OSINT:  IIR 33-1GGH-76+070 WLOS ABC 13, "GRA TAKE CREDIT FOR SUICIDE ATTACK ON W+070 AGAINST THE UN TEAM IN THE PRP." (W+082)

(ABC) -- (W+082) FAYETTEVILLE - THE GOD'S RIGHT ARMY (GRA) ORGANIZATION POSTED A VIDEO CLAIMING CREDIT FOR THE ATTACK ON THE UNITED NATIONS (UN) DELEGATION IN FAYETTEVILLE.  TWO DELEGATES WERE KILLED IN THIS BRUTAL AND SENSELESS ATTACK: JUAN ORTIZ, THE DELEGATION CHIEF AND LIZ SOLEWSKI.  THE UN ISSUED CONDOLENCES TO THE FAMILIES AND REITERATED THAT IT WOULD CONTINUE TO WORK IN THE PRP, REGARDLESS OF THE DANGER SINCE THEY BELIEVE MANY INNOCENT CITIZENS ARE AT RISK AND INACTION WOULD LEAD TO MANY MORE DEATHS, ESPECIALLY OF THE MOST VULNERABLE.  THE GRA VIDEO HIGHLIGHTS THAT FOREIGNERS HAVE "RAPED THE LAND AND MINDS OF THE PEOPLE IN THE FORMER NPP BY BRINGING UNCLEAN RELIGIONS AND TRADITIONS TO A ONCE PROUD NATION."

      B. OSINT:  IIR 34-3617-451+451+083 WPRP NEWS, "PERSON STRUCK, KILLED BY TRAIN IN MEBANE." (W+083)

(WPRP) -- (W+082) MEBANE - A PEDESTRIAN HAS DIED AFTER BEING STRUCK BY AN AMTRAK TRAIN HEADED TO RALEIGH.  OFFICIALS SAY THE TRAIN WAS HEADED FROM CHARLOTTE TO NEW YORK, UPA WHEN IT HIT A PEDESTRIAN ON THE TRACKS IN MEBANE AT APPROXIMATELY 9:20 A.M. FRIDAY MORNING.  OFFICIALS ALSO INDICATED THERE WAS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO CONCLUDE THE INDIVIDUAL WAS ATTEMPTING TO DAMAGE THE TRACK IN AN EFFORT TO DERAIL THE TRAIN, THEREFORE THE INCIDENT WAS BEING INVESTIGATED BY THE ISC AS AN ACT OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM.  
     THE TRAIN HAD BEEN DUE TO STOP IN RALEIGH ABOUT AN HOUR LATER.  OFFICIALS SAY THERE WERE 118 PASSENGERS ON THE TRAIN, WITH NO OTHER INJURIES BEING REPORTED.  REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE REFUSED TO BE INTERVIEWED, BUT DID STATE THAT THERE WERE NO GOVERNMENT OR ISC PERSONNEL ON THE TRAIN MAKING THIS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE TERRORIST'S WILLINGNESS TO STRIKE AT CIVILIAN TARGETS.  THE TRAIN IS ON HOLD PENDING THE CONCLUSION OF THE INVESTIGATION.

   3) COASTAL.

      (A) INCREASED ISC OPERATIONS, COMBINED WITH THE RECENT CAPTURES OF GUERILLA RECRUITS ATTEMPTING TO CROSS INTO THE PRP FORM THE ROP (W+074), MAY HAVE LED TO THE DECREASED ACTIVITY NOTED FROM THE GUERILLA BANDS.  GUERILLAS ARE LIKELY RE-SUPPLYING AND PLANNING FUTURE OPERATIONS IN ORDER TO RECOVER FROM "OPERATION COPPERHEAD" (W+036 TO W+050).  HUMAN INTELLIGENCE (HUMINT) SOURCES REPORTING FROM OPERATION COPPERHEAD INDICATED THAT PRP SECURITY FORCES OBSERVED FLAGS DISPLAYING A "BEAR PAW" BEING FLOWN OVER POSITIONS FROM WHERE THE 1ST MEF UNIT TOOK FIRE NEAR ELIZABETHTOWN.  THESE FLAGS WERE NOT IN PLACE DURING OPERATION COPPERHEAD, BUT WERE RAISED AFTER THE WITHDRAWAL FROM THE AREA.  THE WHITE FLAGS WITH A BEAR PAW LIKELY SYMBOLIZE THE GUERILLAS' CONTROL OVER THE AREA, AS WELL AS TO REMIND LOCALS THE THAT GUERILLAS WILL BE THERE LONG AFTER THE UPA HAS LEFT THE FORMER NPP.

      (B) RECENTLY A GUERILLA UNIT CARRIED OUT A SUCCESSFUL RAID AGAINST THE ELIZABETHTOWN ARMORY.  THE SUCCESS OF THIS MISSION EMPHASIZED AN INCREASED TACTICAL PROFICIENCY IN THE [COASTAL] RESISTANCE, AND THE BOLD ATTITUDE OF THE REBEL FORCES.  SOME SOURCES CLOSE TO THE PRO-ROP COORDINATION GROUPS SUSPECT THAT THE GUERILLAS RECEIVED ASSISTANCE THROUGHOUT THE PREPARATION AND CONDUCT OF THE RAID FROM MEMBERS OF THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT IN ELIZABETHTOWN.  THESE SOURCES ALSO INDICATED THAT UNITED PROVINCES OF ATLANTICA (UPA) ADVISORS ARE TRAINING SPECIALIZED PRP UNITS TO INFILTRATE THE ROP IN ORDER TO CONDUCT LIMITED SABOTAGE AND SUBVERSION AGAINST THE ROP MILITARY TARGETS.  HOWEVER, THIS INFORMATION CANNOT BE CORROBORATED.   

   4) REPUBLIC OF PINELAND (ROP).

      (A) COORDINATION GROUPS IN THE ROP CONTINUE TO PURSUE ALL METHODS AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT THE CAUSE OF THE GUERILLAS.  ONE GROUP IN PARTICULAR ADOPTED THE PINELAND RESISTANCE FORCE (PRF) MONIKER TO PROVIDE A HOPEFUL, UNIFYING VOICE TO THE GUERILLAS THAT ARE STILL FRAGMENTED AND UNORGANIZED (BETWEEN TERRITORIES AND BETWEEN GROUPS WITHIN THE PIEDMONT TERRITORY). MOST GUERILLAS BELIEVE IN THE COMPLETE EXPULSION OF THE UPA AND SOME TYPE OF RECONCILIATION WITH THE PATON REGIME, ALBEIT WITH SIGNIFICANT REFORMS FROM THE FORMER STATUS QUO.

      (B) TACTICAL REPORT (TACREP) (UPDATE)/GHT-789 (EXERCISE CLASSIFIED SENSITIVE). W+082

THE ROP ATTORNEY GENERAL RE-FILED CHARGES AGAINST NICHOLAS CHRISTIAN AND HIS BROTHER, KEEL, OF ESPIONAGE.  HE ACCUSED THE CURRENT ISC COMMANDER OF NEFARIOUS TIES WITH SELECT MILITARY OFFICIALS IN THE UPA AND MEMBERS OF THE ADU.  THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE FROM THE OLD DOMINION PROVINCE AND RALLY ACTIVELY FOR THE REUNIFICATION OF THE TAR HEEL PROVINCE BACK TO THE UPA.  THE INVESTIGATIONS ON THIS MATTER CONTINUE AS MENTIONED IN PREVIOUS REPORTS (TACREP/GHT-H089-6687, INTSUM 25).

D. ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION.

   1) THE "RELATIVE CALM" REPORTED ACROSS THE PRP AS BEING THE RESULT OF THE GOVERNMENT WORKING FOR THE PEOPLE IS MORE LIKELY THE RESULT OF THE POPULATION RESOURCE CONTROL MEASURES AND CONSTANT ACTIVITY OF THE ISC.  THEY WILL CONTINUE TO APPLY PRESSURE TO THE RESISTANCE, MOVING TO THE RURAL AREAS AS CALM IS BROUGHT TO THE URBAN AREAS.  NFI

24_12_CYRIL	ACK RECEIPT.  DISTRIBUTED TO CDR AND STAFF 
25_12_RFI	ACK RECEIPT.  SEE BELOW / CLOSED

   3) RE: 25_12_RFI; COUGAR REQUESTS CLARIFICATION ON THE GEOGRAPHIC BOUNDARIES OF THE SPECIAL EXCLUSION ZONES (REF. 42_09_INSUM 34-5).
      RESPONSE: ALL AVAILABLE INFORMATION REGARDING THE EXCLUSION ZONES WAS PROVIDED IN THE REPORTING.  THE ORIGINAL REPORTING DID NOT INCLUDE ANY DESCRIPTION, OR GRAPHIC (MAP) REPRESENTATION, OF THE BOUNDARIES OF THE AREA.  THE ASSUMPTION MADE BY US WAS THAT IT ROUGHLY COINCIDE WITH THE CITY LIMITS OF FAYETTEVILLE, WITH AN INCLUDED BUFFER OF 2 TO 3 KM'S.  ADDITIONALLY, BASED ON PRE-SECESSION ISSUES SURROUNDING SPRING LAKE, OUR ASSUMPTION IS THAT THE EXCLUSION ZONE INCLUDES THE AREA WITHIN THE CITY LIMITS OF SPRING LAKE, WITH 2 TO 3 KM BUFFER, BUT WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE ORIGINAL REPORTING.  WE CONTINUE TO ATTEMPT TO GAIN RESOLUTION TO THE DETAILS SURROUNDING THE ISSUE AND WILL PROVIDE THEM AS THEY BECOME AVAILABLE.  NFI / CJ2

F. COMMENTS.

   1) OPERATIONS SERGEANT MAJOR (OPS SGM) COMMENTS. ALTHOUGH REPORTING ACROSS THE JSOA CONTINUES TO INDICATE IT IS QUIET, THE ISC CONTINUE TO ACTIVELY SEEK OUT THE RESISTANCE IN ALL AREAS.  ENSURE YOU ARE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO MITIGATE RISK AND REDUCE YOUR SIGNATURE.  OPS SGM

   2) OPERATIONS CENTER DIRECTOR (OPCEN DIR) COMMENTS.  HOPEFULLY YOU'VE HAD SOME TIME TO GET A FEEL FOR YOUR SURROUNDINGS AND EMPLACE SOME SECURITY/ESTABLISH SOME EARLY WARNING MEASURES, SO NOW IT SHOULD BE TIME TO GET DOWN TO BUSINESS.  AS YOU BEGIN TO MOVE ABOUT MORE AND MORE, REMEMBER... YOU ARE A FOREIGNER IN DENIED TERRITORY.  THE LPP GOVERNMENT ORDERED THE DETENTION OF ALL FOREIGNERS RIGHT AFTER THE SECESSION (NSAD-R-12-045_INTSUM 23 (W+001 to W+007)), AND HAVE ONLY INCREASED EFFORTS TO LOCATE AND CAPTURE THE RESISTANCE OVER TIME - YOU MUST REMAIN VIGILANT OR EVENTUALLY YOU WILL PAY A DEAR PRICE...ONE YOU OR WE CANT AFFORD. CONTINUED GOOD LUCK, CJ3
